Sindavar33 for making Stoneborn (best UI texture pack - fight me) {I also stole the Furnace and Stonecutter UIs for the Clayworks and Woodworks support. No clue why the mod devs didn't make them copy the vanilla stations, but whatever}.

Fr_z_n for making the main modded compat add-on. It was awesome (still hoping it gets ported to 1.20 lol), and some of the support for Missing Mods is based on his work.

The ARASH on the Stoneborn discord server for giving me the brick background texture. No way I would've gotten it otherwise lol.

KingLemming & Team CoFH for making the Thermal mods (even though the way they handle UI assets is annoying - but ultimately better than anything I would've done lol. I just wish all the UIs were in a single mod or something). I've used them ever since I got the game, and it's consistently been the best tech mod (I still miss Tesseracts though :'c). Adding TE support first probably wasn't the best idea, but it was a great learning experience.

Also all the devs of all the other mods this supports (can't make a support pack without mods to support, after all).
