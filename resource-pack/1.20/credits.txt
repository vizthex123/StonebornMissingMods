Sindavar33 for making Stoneborn (best UI texture pack - fight me) {I also stole the Furnace and Stonecutter UIs for the Clayworks and Woodworks support. No clue why the mod devs didn't make them use the vanilla stations' UIs, but whatever}.

Fr_z_n for making the main modded compat add-on. It was awesome (so glad I was able to port it!). Old versions of this pack use some of the support he made.

The ARASH on the Stoneborn discord server for giving me the brick background texture. No way I would've gotten it otherwise lol. He also made the Uncrafting Table UI in v1.5.

xKeru on the Stoneborn discord server for making the fancy arrows used in the the Nature's Aura's Altar JEI tab in v2.1

KingLemming & Team CoFH for making the Thermal mods (even though the way they handle UI assets is annoying - but ultimately better than anything I would've done lol. I just wish all the UIs were in a single mod or something). I've used them ever since I got the game, and it's consistently been the best tech mod (I still miss Tesseracts though :'c). Adding TE support first probably wasn't the best idea, but it was a great learning experience.

Also all the devs of all the other mods this supports (can't make a support pack without mods to support, after all).
