I made this for [my modpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2) because none of the mod compat add-ons I found for [Stoneborn](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/stoneborn) support the mods this one does, or they have a few broken implementations (e.g. all of Botania's JEI categories are fine except for the Botanical Brewery). Might as well toss in any other add-ons you can find too.

Due to this, I highly recommend installing [Stoneborn - Extended](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-extended) and [Modded Compatibility GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-modded-compatibility-sbmc) (and [Meï's Additions for Modded GUIs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-meis-additions-for-modded-guis) if you're on 1.19.2 or 1.20.1).

Feel free to suggest support I should add on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornMissingModsCompat/issues) or [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X).

*(This also fixes the incorrect pixel in the bottom-left of the inventory UI - just make sure to load it above base Stoneborn)*
