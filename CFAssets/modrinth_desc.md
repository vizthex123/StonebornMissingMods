I made this for [my modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2) (well, [all of them](https://www.curseforge.com/members/vizthex/projects?page=1&pageSize=20&sortBy=ReleaseDate&sortOrder=Desc&classIds=4471) really) because none of the mod compat add-ons I found for [Stoneborn](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/stoneborn) supported the mods this one does, or they have a few broken implementations (e.g. all of Botania's JEI categories are fine except for the Botanical Brewery if you've got the [Modded Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-modded-compatibility-sbmc) add-on).

*I'm hoping someone else adds support for these mods and does it better (as I can't texture for the life of me), but until then we're stuck with this add-on.*

Due to this, I highly recommend installing [Modded Compatibility GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-modded-compatibility-sbmc) and [Stoneborn - Extended](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-extended) (or [Meï's Additions for Modded GUIs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-meis-additions-for-modded-guis) if you're on 1.20.1+) and any other mod support add-ons you can find (as they'd do a much better job than I ever could).

Feel free to suggest support I should add on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornMissingMods/issues) or [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X).

*(This also fixes the incorrect pixel in the bottom-left of the inventory UI - just make sure to load it above base Stoneborn)*
