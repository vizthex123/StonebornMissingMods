I made this for [my modpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2) because none of the mod compat add-ons I found for [Stoneborn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn) support the mods this one does, or they have a few broken implementations (e.g. all of Botania's JEI categories are fine except for the Botanical Brewery) - so I figured I'd try to add support for some of the missing mods myself.

Since I only plan to cover missing mods (as I'm not that good at the texturing), I highly recommend installing [Stoneborn - Extended](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-extended) and [Modded Compatibility GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-modded-compatibility-sbmc) (and [Meï's Additions for Modded GUIs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-meis-additions-for-modded-guis) if you're on 1.19.2 or 1.20.1) so you have coverage for some of the major mods you might have installed.

Feel free to suggest support I should add in the comments, on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornMissingModsCompat/issues), or in [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X).

*(This also fixes the incorrect pixel in the bottom-left of the inventory UI - just make sure to load it above base Stoneborn)*
