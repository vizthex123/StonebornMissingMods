# "You Can Use It" license

You can use this resource pack in any modpack (including ones you publish) and modify it however you want - just don't redistribute it without my permission.

In fact, I'd prefer if someone with any sort of texturing talent could make their own add-on for all the versions this supports (or at least 1.18+) since I'm barely capable of making a square that doesn't look like shit lol. I'll even give you all the source files if ya want.

Credit is not required, but is appreciated (as I spent *far* too long making this lol).
