# Stoneborn: Missing Mods

Adds Stoneborn support for a few mods that other add-ons don't support.

Feel free to suggest mod support on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornMissingMods/issues), comments section of the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-missing-mods/comments), or [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X) - just make sure another add-on doesn't add support (since they'd do a much better job than I ever could)

*View the list [here](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornMissingMods/blob/main/CFAssets/support_table.md) (or check either project page).*
