# Stoneborn: Missing Mods Changelog

A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [resource pack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-missing-mods).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support, and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. [1.20] Text Here) denote changes that only apply to that version.
--------------------------------------------------

## v1.2

*There's a lot of mod support I'd like to add, but I'm holding out hope that the modded compat add-on gets ported (since it does a vastly better job for the mods I want to add support for). So, if it doesn't get ported I'll try to add support myself.*

Ported to 1.20.1

Retextured item slots in Malum's JEI tabs
- Sadly, I can't backport this change since the assets either don't exist or are buried somewhere (even the dev wasn't sure about it lol) - but at least they finally match on this version.

Added gold coloured text for Crafting Automat
- I can't do this for every mod (since most re-use the block name, and changing the block's name to gold looks wrong) - but I will try to do it for any mods that use a separate lang line for container UIs.

Mod support added:
- Crafting Tweaks
- Industrial Foregoing Souls
- Maulm (the 2 new JEI tabs that were added)
- Thermal Extra (it's got machines in this version)

<br />

## v1.0

*This update adds all the support I initially planned (in addition to five other mods), so we're finally at v1.0!*

*Feel free to suggest other mods to add support for - just make sure to check if another Stoneborn add-on does it, as this one is meant to cover mods that better add-ons don't do.*

<br />

Fixed the incorrect decal spacing on Thermal Series UIs<br />
Finished Thermal Series support (realized I missed quite a few buttons)<br />
