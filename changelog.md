# Stoneborn: Missing Mods Changelog

A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [resource pack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-missing-mods).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support, and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. [1.20] Text Here) denote changes that only apply to that version.

## v1.0

*This update adds all the support I initially planned (in addition to five other mods), so we're finally at v1.0!*

*Feel free to suggest other mods to add support for - just make sure to check if another Stoneborn add-on does it, as this one is meant to cover mods that better add-ons don't do.*

<br />

Fixed the incorrect decal spacing on Thermal Series UIs<br />
Finished Thermal Series support (realized I missed quite a few buttons)<br />
Changed the colour of button icons on Thermal Series and Industrial Foregoing UIs
- If y'all think it was better beforehand, let me know and I can revert it.
