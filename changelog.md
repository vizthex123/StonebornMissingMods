# Stoneborn: Missing Mods Changelog

A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [resource pack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-missing-mods).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support, and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. [1.20] Text Here) denote changes that only apply to that version.
--------------------------------------------------

## v0.5

Fixed missing pixels on several progress arrows from Extended Crafting<br />
Fixed filled Auto Table arrows (from Extended Crafting) not matching their unfilled ones

Mod support added:
- Botania (Botanical Brewery JEI fix)
- FTB Quests (quest reward JEI tab)
- Industrial Foregoing
- Nature's Aura

<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------

## v0.1

Initial release cuz I got tired of doing UI textures lol.

Supports Extended Crafting and Thermal Series (plus the Systeams and Extra add-ons).

*Re-uploaded this one shortly afterwards to fix the Blast Chiller's JEI progress bar missing a line of pixels.*
